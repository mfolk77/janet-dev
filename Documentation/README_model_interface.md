# Janet Model Interface Fixes

This document explains the fixes implemented for the Model Interface component of the Janet app.

## Problem

The Model Interface component had several issues that were causing build errors:

1. **Conflicting OllamaModel declarations**: The `OllamaModel` was defined both as a class in `ModelInterface.swift` and as a struct in `OllamaService.swift`, causing type conflicts.
2. **Decoder conformance issues**: The `OllamaModel` struct needed to conform to `Codable` for JSON decoding.
3. **Type lookup ambiguities**: The compiler couldn't determine which `OllamaModel` declaration to use in various contexts.
4. **Invalid redeclaration errors**: Multiple declarations of the same type across different files.
5. **Method compatibility issues**: The `OllamaModelImpl` class was trying to call methods that don't exist in the `OllamaService` class.

## Solution

The `fix_model_interface.sh` script implements several improvements to resolve these issues:

1. **Renamed OllamaModel class**: Changed the class name from `OllamaModel` to `OllamaModelImpl` in `ModelInterface.swift` to avoid conflicts.
2. **Consistent struct definition**: Ensured the `OllamaModel` struct in `OllamaService.swift` properly conforms to `Codable`.
3. **Updated factory methods**: Updated the `ModelFactory` methods to return `OllamaModelImpl` instances.
4. **Fixed logging references**: Updated all logging statements to use the new class name.
5. **Method compatibility fixes**: Updated the `OllamaModelImpl` class to use the methods that are actually available in the `OllamaService` class.

## Implementation Details

### 1. OllamaModelImpl Class

The class was renamed from `OllamaModel` to `OllamaModelImpl`:

```swift
/// OllamaModelImpl implementation that uses the OllamaService
public class OllamaModelImpl: JanetAIModel {
    private let logger = Logger(subsystem: Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier ?? "com.janet.ai", category: "OllamaModelImpl")
    // Use the shared service from the app
    private var ollamaService: OllamaService 
    private let modelType: ModelType
    
    // Whether the model is loaded
    public private(set) var isLoaded: Bool = false
    
    // ... rest of implementation ...
}
```

### 2. OllamaModel Struct

The struct definition was kept consistent for JSON decoding:

```swift
// Add OllamaModel struct for backward compatibility
struct OllamaModel: Codable {
    let name: String
    let modified_at: String
    let size: Int64
}
```

### 3. Factory Methods

The factory methods were updated to use the new class name:

```swift
/// Create a model of the specified type
public static func createModel(type: ModelType, modelPath: String, tokenizerPath: String) -> any JanetAIModel {
    logger.info("Creating model of type: \(String(describing: type))")
    
    // Create OllamaModelImpl for all model types
    logger.info("Creating OllamaModelImpl instance for type: \(type.rawValue)")
    return OllamaModelImpl(modelType: type)
}
```

### 4. Method Compatibility Fixes

The `OllamaModelImpl` class was updated to use the methods that are actually available in the `OllamaService` class:

```swift
// Instead of using startOllama() which doesn't exist
let isRunning = await ollamaService.checkOllamaStatus()

// Instead of using getAvailableModels() which doesn't exist
await ollamaService.loadAvailableModels()

// Instead of using generateText() which doesn't exist
let response = await ollamaService.generateResponse(prompt: prompt)
```

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Run the model interface fix script:
   ```bash
   cd /Volumes/Folk_DAS/Janet_Clean
   ./fix_model_interface.sh
   ```

2. The script will:
   - Rename the `OllamaModel` class to `OllamaModelImpl` in `ModelInterface.swift`
   - Ensure the `OllamaModel` struct exists in `OllamaService.swift` with proper `Codable` conformance
   - Update all references to use the correct types
   - Fix method compatibility issues

3. Alternatively, you can run the comprehensive fix script:
   ```bash
   cd /Volumes/Folk_DAS/Janet_Clean
   ./fix_all_issues.sh
   ```

## Benefits

After implementing this fix:

1. The `OllamaModel` class and struct no longer conflict with each other
2. JSON decoding works correctly with the `OllamaModel` struct
3. Type lookup ambiguities are resolved
4. The code is more maintainable with clear separation between the class and struct implementations
5. The `OllamaModelImpl` class now uses the correct methods from the `OllamaService` class

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience issues with the Model Interface:

1. Make sure the fixed files are properly included in your Xcode project
2. Check that all references to `OllamaModel` in `ModelInterface.swift` have been updated to `OllamaModelImpl`
3. Verify that the `OllamaModel` struct in `OllamaService.swift` has the correct properties and `Codable` conformance
4. Ensure that any code that uses the model factory is updated to work with the new class name
5. Verify that the `OllamaModelImpl` class is using the correct methods from the `OllamaService` class
