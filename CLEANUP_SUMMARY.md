# Janet Project Cleanup Summary

## What Was Done

1. **Analyzed Project Structure**
   - Identified core components: Swift/Xcode app and MCP system
   - Identified unnecessary files and directories
   - Mapped out the build process

2. **Removed Unnecessary Files and Directories**
   - Deleted `build_tmp` directory (128MB)
   - Removed `mcp-system/node_modules` (118MB)
   - Removed `Backup_Jarvis` directory
   - Removed `.DS_Store` files
   - Removed backup files

3. **Created Cleanup Tools**
   - Created `cleanup_janet.sh` script to remove unnecessary files
   - Created `simplified_build.sh` script for a cleaner build process
   - Created `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` to document the project structure

4. **Results**
   - Reduced project size from 246MB+ to 7.2MB
   - Simplified project structure
   - Documented core components and build process

## Project Structure

The Janet project now has a cleaner structure:

```
Janet_25/
├── Builds/                  # Contains the built Janet.app
├── Source_Code/             # Main source code for the Swift app
│   ├── Janet/               # Core application code
│   └── Janet.xcodeproj/     # Xcode project file
├── mcp-system/              # MCP middleware component (without node_modules)
│   └── src/                 # TypeScript source code
├── build_janet.sh           # Script to build the app
├── simplified_build.sh      # Simplified build script
├── cleanup_janet.sh         # Script to clean up the project
├── launch_janet.sh          # Script to launch the app
└── PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md     # Documentation of project structure
```

## Core Components

### 1. Swift/Xcode App
The main Janet application is a Swift app built with Xcode. It provides the user interface and core functionality.

Key components:
- **Services**: Core services like Ollama integration, memory management, etc.
- **Views**: SwiftUI views for the user interface
- **Models**: Data models used throughout the application

### 2. MCP System
The MCP (Master Control Program) is a Node.js-based middleware component that provides additional functionality to Janet.

Key components:
- **TypeScript source code**: The core logic of the MCP
- **Node.js dependencies**: Required for the MCP to function (can be reinstalled as needed)

## How to Use

1. **Building the App**
   - Run `./build_janet.sh` to build the app
   - The built app will be in `Builds/Janet.app`

2. **Launching the App**
   - Run `./launch_janet.sh` to launch the app
   - This will start the Janet application

3. **Cleaning Up**
   - Run `./cleanup_janet.sh` to remove unnecessary files
   - This will free up disk space without affecting functionality

4. **MCP System**
   - If you need to modify the MCP system, reinstall dependencies with:
     ```
     cd mcp-system && npm install
     ```

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Keep the project clean**
   - Regularly run `./cleanup_janet.sh` to remove temporary files
   - Avoid committing large binary files to version control

2. **Modular development**
   - Keep the Swift app and MCP system separate
   - Use clear interfaces between components

3. **Documentation**
   - Maintain the `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` file
   - Document new components as they are added

4. **Build process**
   - Use the simplified build script for faster builds
   - Clean up build artifacts after successful builds
